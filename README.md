# DigitalShapeFitting
This project consists of implementation for fitting a digital annulus from a set of points in 2D grid.
The optimal solution can be found in *Optimal2DDigitalAnnulusFitting* folder. 
A version with a trade-off between the accuracy and the running time can be found in *DigitalAnnulusFittingBoundedError2D* folder.
